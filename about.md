I'm a software developer from Maring√°-PR, Brazil.

I've been doing stuff with software professionally for about 4 years.

I have a broad experience, ranging from Java, PHP and Python to front-end shenanigans and AngularJS.

But I'm a constant learner and won't stop here. Bring it on.

Currently developing and loving Elixir.

Here is my resume in [english] and [portuguese], by the way.

[english]: /en
[portuguese]: /pt
